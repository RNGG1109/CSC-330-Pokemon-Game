# CSC-330-Pokemon-Game
A pokemon fight simulation using OOP!

It's you against the opponent that does random things in a pokemon fight.
If you never played pokemon before then here's the rundown:
1) Choose which pokemon to send out first
2) Pick one of the four moves to use against the oppenents pokemon
3) There are also items you can use to heal your pokemon

Message to future me:
change the files to .javas so you dont have to copy and paste all the code manually
